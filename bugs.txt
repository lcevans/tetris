Bugs:
- misc blocks appear at the top. I think this is because a new block which sticks out of the top or side gives a collision => is seen as landed
- Not all pieces appear (probably some cannot because they collider with ceiling or walls)
- Cannot slide pieces into cracks

Improvements:
- Add outlines to squares in pieces
